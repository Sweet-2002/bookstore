                aiming to provide a deeper understanding of cosmology for general readers. The book is a compilation of
                his lectures, covering significant concepts such as the Big Bang, black holes, and the nature of space
                and time. Hawking discusses how the universe originated, evolved, and might end, making complex ideas

                Stephen Hawking was a brilliant theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author known for his
                groundbreaking work on black holes and the nature of the universe. Despite being diagnosed with ALS at a
                young age, he made remarkable contributions to science, including the discovery that black holes emit
                radiation, now known as Hawking radiation.
